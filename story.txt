We struggled hard as fuck,
flying on LSD.
A turkey hit the windshield,
and Bob yelled, “Fuck!,” 
then proceeded to jump off the train.
Honey was the only thing that could clear our minds.
We raided the local bee hive,
but ran into a bear named Silt.
He was a little salty that we intruded on his honey smuggling business.
He turned and said, “You don’t have to outrun the bear, just the other guy.”
