We struggled hard as fuck,
flying on LSD.
A turkey hit the windshield,
and Bob yelled, “Fuck!,” 
then proceeded to jump off the train.
Honey was the only thing that could clear our minds.
We raided the local bee hive,
but ran into a bear named Silt.
He was a little salty that we intruded on his honey smuggling business.
He turned and said, “You don’t have to outrun the bear, just the other guy.”
So we proceeded to trip Bob and make a run for that honey!
In the hours to follow, we reflected on our actions. Was the honey really worth it?
While in deep contemplation of our actions, I woke up and hit my head on the top of my bunk bed.
